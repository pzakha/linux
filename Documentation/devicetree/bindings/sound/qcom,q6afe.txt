Qualcomm Audio Front End (Q6AFE) binding

AFE is one of the APR audio service on Q6DSP
Please refer to qcom,apr.txt for details of the common apr service bindings
used by all apr services.

- but must contain the following property:

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "qcom,afe-v<MAJOR-NUMBER>.<MINOR-NUMBER>"
		  Or "qcom,afe" where the version number can be queried
		  from DSP.
		  example "qcom,afe-v2.0"

= AFE DAIs (Digial Audio Interface)
"dais" subnode of the AFE node represents dai specific configuration

- #sound-dai-cells
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Must be 1

- reg
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Must be dai id

- interface-type
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: Must be one of following
	"mi2s"
	"hdmi"
	"pcm"
	"slim"

- qcom,sd-lines
	Usage: required for mi2s interface
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Must be list of serial data lines used by this dai.
	should be one or more of the 1-4 sd lines.
